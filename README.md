# NHANES_Regression

Oral health is essential to public health. It consists of tooth decay, gum disease, loss of teeth, oral cancer, oro-dental trauma, noma, congenital malformations, and other mouth diseases or disorders. Unqualified oral disease is becoming a global burden as individuals worldwide suffer from poor oral health. This research aimed to use the NHANES 2013-2018 cycle to evaluate the association between smoking status and oral health conditions, as well as the time of quitting smoking and oral health conditions. The participants of this research were adults who participated in the NHANES national representative survey aged between 18-50 years old. The multivariable logistic regression was conducted with covariates to adjust the fitness of the model. From our study, there was a significant difference between different smoking statuses in the oral health condition. Meanwhile, the time of quitting smoking may also display differences in various oral health conditions. The paper concluded that smoking status is associated with oral health conditions and that current smokers should be aware of the higher risk of unqualified oral conditions than former smokers or never smokers. Furthermore, the association between the length of time after giving up tobacco and oral health is proved as the longer former smokers quit smoking, the better their oral health condition may be.
